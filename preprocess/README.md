# Document Preprocessing

Used to process PubMed Central files and produce three types of output:

1. Plain text with just the textual content.
1. LIF files with sentence, token, POS, and lemma annotations.
1. Normalized texts with stop words removed and all text converted to lowercase.  This is intended as input to machine learning algorigthms (word2vec etc al.)

## Running

TBD

- a command line program
- startup requirements for jmx
